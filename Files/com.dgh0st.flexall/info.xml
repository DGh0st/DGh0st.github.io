		<description>Just another FLEX loader. Why? because we need one more. This one flexes on all other loaders ;D</description>
		<description>FLEX (Flipboard Explorer) is a set of debugging and exploration tools for iOS development. When presented, FLEX shows a toolbar that lives in a window above your application. From this toolbar, you can view and modify nearly every piece of state in your running application.</description>
		<description>Activation:
			- Long press on status bar (pre-iOS 13)
			- Long press anywhere with three finger
		</description>
		<description>Additional Features:
			- Displayed above Alerts (including SpringBoard alerts)
			- Prevent sleep on lockscreen when using exploring through the FLEX views
			- Dismiss explorer window using the done navigation bar instead of having to go all the way to initial view
